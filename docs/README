Kiroku, at this point, requires a bit of file editing to get up and running. An automatic installer is in the works as well as even simplifying these installation rules. Total time for installation is only a few minutes.

Requirements:

    * Web Server (tested with Apache 1.3+ and 2+)
    * PHP 5.2.1 or higher
    * MySQL 5 or higher
    * PHPMyAdmin (optional) 

How To Install:

   1. Checkout the source from http://code.google.com/p/Kiroku/source/checkout
   2. Edit the following files:
          * app/config/config.ini 
   3. Create a new MySQL database on your host
   4. Import setup/db/*.sql files into the MySQL database
   5. Upload the files to your web host
   6. Visit your website to make sure that everything works
   7. Log into http://<domain name>/admin as:
   		username:	root
   		password:	start1234
   8. Go to the 'Users' page, click on 'root', and enter a new password

Caveats

The code currently is using the shortag option for PHP but that is being changed. The .htaccess file supplied in SVN may need to be changed to however your webhost wants PHP ini directives set. You may need to make other changes on your host to get this to work, for example on 1and1 hosting you need to add a directive to parse PHP as PHP5 instead of the default of PHP4.
