<h2>Delete Domain</h2>

<h3>WARNING</h3>
<p>
Are you sure you want to delete '{site_name}'? Deleting an entire domain will remove <u><i><b>ALL</b></i></u> pages associated with it, and there will be no way to retrieve these pages short of a database restore. Only delete the domain if you are sure that you will never need the information contained in it again.

<p>
We strongly recommend that, if there is a chance you will need this information again, to simply deactivate the domain so that the information is stored in the database for later use.
